# [Qt+OpenGL] N bodies problem visualization app

## Introduction
This is an application that simulates the movement of spherical bodies in space, taking into account their gravitational influence on each other and displays them in real time. The calculation of the velocities of bodies is implemented using the 4th order Runge-Kutta numerical integration method.
